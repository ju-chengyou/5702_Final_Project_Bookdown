# Data Transformation
Since the dataset is stored in a neat `.csv` file, we simply read the file using the `read.csv` method and store the data in the data frame `job`. Later, when we need some specific attributes of the job postings dataset, we can use simply `$` or pipes and the `%>%` operator to extract the columns we need.

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Load all packages needed for our project
library(dplyr)
library(corpus)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(forcats)
library(tidyverse)
library(tm)
library(htmlTable)
library(ggridges)

```
```{r}
job <- read.csv("data/raw/NYC_Jobs.csv") # Read data from csv file
job[job == ''] <- NA # Set empty slots as NAs

job <-job[!duplicated(job), ]
```
